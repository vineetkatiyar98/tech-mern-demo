1.	Github is a cloud service
2.	Used to host, upload our own source code. (php, python all languages)
3.	Github product Microsoft.


Git : tool
Github : cloud ( )
Other options than github:- open source and close source
1.	Gitlab:  
2.	Bitbucket : open source
3.	Bitkeeper : owner (git’s owner) : open source

 Git :- is a cli(command line interface) unix based and linux based tool
Git is a SCM or VCM or VCS
SCM:-(source code management )
VCM:-(version control management)
VCS:-(version control software)

Git has two flavours :-
1.	Github desktop  version (GUI)
2.	Git bash version (CLI) : 

Using git bash one can run linux/unix commands in, windows OS/mac/

$ Linux Command using $
Linux was invented by linux torwald.
Unix, was made by ken Thompson. ( paid :- no body can use it for free)

Linux torwald made a copy of unix.
Unix is pre installed in severs.
Git  is developed by linux torwald 
Then , bit keeper was a cloud made by them.


Linux community is , all free and open source.

Bitkeepr , first and oldest cloud.
Partnership with Microsoft stolen the idea of bit keeper and create github.

Rule : you have , r+ permission 
If you don’t have permission then , access denied no sufficient permission. 
10.	Moving inside/outside directory :
Cd path-name : inside
Cd ../ for outside

./ or current 
../ or parent

11.	Rm -r <file-name> : this will delete all folder shift+delete

Folder : rm -r folder name


How to pass range : -
Command {start..end}


How to change drive :- 
Cd x : hit enter
X is drive name

Chmod : is used to change the permission code of user group  to owner 
Super user(su)
Super user mode : 777 permission. 
Chmod <mod-number or permission number> <path>
Chmod 77./

1.	Git pull or fetch --all or git clone   download
2.	Git push or upstream  upload

Important key points about github
https://github .com/vineetkatiyar98/reop-name.git
https://github.com/awnishmmg/PHP-Documentation.git (awanish sir)

important information related git repo:-
1.	Every git repo has its permission 
2.	Every git repo will have readme file
3.	Every gilt repo may have or may not have license.
(public repo: any body can see and download (cloneorigin) 
ii. private
or any body can fork (cloneupstream), and any body can watch.
4.	Every git repo will have visibility status
5.	Every repo will have its own owner and its own branch by default branch name is master and after august-2021 master name was changed to main in github. 

(awnishmmg github)
.gitignore :- 

Git clone cloud to local download
Git fork code one github account --> 2nd git account -> download

Public reop 

How to initialise a variable in c :

int a = 20; // declaration and intialize 
printf("a = %d,a")
print a value

A variable use
similarly 

before u can use, any repo(private or public) it has sdto be initialized.


Initialized in github and initialized in local:
-------------------------------------------------------------
step are ;

1. repo name --> ownre --> master branch or main branch

initialized in github : 

2. repo Description(optional)
3. visibility mode : private or public
4. readme .md I.
5.gitignore 
6. license 

any specific brach : by default main --> change --> master

Initializtion in local :

before u commit(final save) owner informaation is mandatory.

Git will ask who are you before u commit:

there are two ways of adding author information 

1. local -> multiple user ->local to the user
2. global -> single user -> globally

consider, system

guest-1 local user
guest-2 local user 

admin local user 

if there is one then you have to set author/owner informaation globally.

How to add and show author username and email:

$git config  -->global user.name

$git config-- global user.email

for locally :

$git config - local user.name 
$git config - local user.email

note :- if you supply the value, then set or if you not it will show

note :- for string value if space seperated string value then in command line " " is mandatory 

every space wala sentance should be insidde " " ke ander.


adding author/ owner information globally :

$ git config - global username.name "vineet katiyar"

-----------------------------------------------

1. difference between detached HEAD(recent commit me kiya gya chechout HEAD se detache ho jata hai.
and detached  HEAD undo : checkout to any commit branch) and BRANCH.
2. what is HEAD ?
(current branch me kiya gya lattest or recent commit HEAD kehlata hai)

How to get deleted files

$ git status
$ git diff
$ git log => commit ID or recent-branch-of-commit
$ git checkout commit ID 
or
$ git checkout . in current branch


How to git PUSH command:
----------------
What is originm : mian cloud server at github, gitlab, Bitbucket or Bitkeeper or heruko(salesforce company)

origin : is recognized as url.
1. https : https://github.com/username/reponame.git
2. SSH : (secure shell) 
{
    i. hostname : DNS lookup [cmd => ping]
    ii. port : 22/21
    iii. username : git username
    iv. password : git password

    or

    SSH  keys or private token

}

3. git cli*(administrator)

what happens in SSH(putty) ?
ans :- connection is set up between direct client to server using shell or terminal.
there are two ways of connecting server using SSH
============================
1. using credential , hostname (Ip) , port 
    1. hostname of ip : cmd => ping url without https/https

    for eg : cmd => ping google.com
    for eg : cmd => ping facebook.com
    for eg : cmd => ping gmial.com

    or

    https://dnslookup.online/

    dns lookup
    dns checker 
    mxtoolbox

    all information related to server and ip can be found using above website whioch include , dns server network ip, hosting server , nameserver ..... etc

(IANA) : INTERNET ASSIGNED NUMBER ATHORITY

2. by-default port :
    ftp : 21 
    sftp : 22
    note : if port not provided, you have to default port for public server.

    note : if network is private, then there may a chance that server may use there own port number.
    for connection you must connect to private port.
    public smtp server : 25
    private server : 2096 <private port>

    protocol -> port assign => IANA 

private port will be given server admin.  

3.usrname : access from server admin
4. password: access from server admin


2nd method
1. Using ssh keys or 
1. Public  : automatically exchange b/w client and server 
2. Private : username and password (private key)
Install → putty →open puttygen 
Generate token 
		→ shake mouse cursor.
		→shaking(algorithm) + machine(MACID) →
		Very very long key 
i. Public
ii. Private => RSA

Client shell ←-------------------------------------→server shell
[data]-------------------→send------------------→[target]
	-----------------------→encrypt---------------→ public key
	←------------------private key -------------------→


How to add ssh key to git repo
 	1. avatar icon →setting → under 

2. Token : 



How to set up origin
$ git remote add origin <reepo-url>

To remove
$ git remote remove origin

Again check remote or origin version
$ git remote -v

or

FTP : 21
SFTP : 22
MYSQL : 3306
SMTP : 25



keys
1. pubic o r master key
2. private key  (then access repo or access server)


1. GUI : penguin/filezilla/winSCP/puTTY
2. shell : gitbash/cmd/puTTY


token = pubic key + private key
